    "### Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is designed to utilize the skills I have learned and apply machine learning techniques to a data set. I went into this project blind and thus this project is meant to outline my method to understand and refine a dataset from scratch and derive insights from it. The initial guidance I recieved was to decide a research question at this point but without understanding the contents of a dataset, its limits and quirks, that would in my humble opinion be impossible to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "My Method is inspired by the one provided in: {insert book title here} (which is available neatly in appendix B pg. 497). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, against the apparent rigid and formulaic nature of the method provided therin I prefer to keep my processes iterative (recursive in a way) and dynamic. The format of this document may lead to you believr that I have gone about this project in clear steps and stages but this is mostly a function of the need for presentability and concistency. The process here is iterative and dynamic.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(Especially between the cleaning and exploratitory parts there is a lot of back and forth in understanding and refining the dataset to a state of usability I deem acceptable.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preliminary Analysis- Preparation for test integrity and studying of each attribute, its noisiness, distribution and possible usefulness for the task ahead.\n",
    "2. Cleaning Data - serves primarily as a cleaning of the dataset but also as an initial analysis of each of the attributes. (This is exhaustive but also good practice in refining a dataset)\n",
    "3. Exploratory Analysis - Explore the datasets relationships and patterns (Note: this is done after the clean so as to not have the exploration biased by missing values, incorrect inputs e.tc )\n",
    "4. Framing - Decide and Assess an objective, think about what a solution would look like, how I would measure its performance and list assumptions.\n",
    "5. Experimentation and refienment - testing models, validating them and evaluating them.\n",
    "6. Presentation and Interpretation - show the results and interpet them in the context of the research question\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary research question that I have detemerined to be answered is that of whether\n",
